**Tweet 1 (hook)**

Every AI agent has amnesia.

You correct it Monday. Tuesday — same mistake.

I fixed this 4 months ago. Today I'm open-sourcing it.

**Tweet 2 (the problem)**

The AI industry is in an arms race for smarter models.

Bigger context windows. Better reasoning. More parameters.

But nobody is solving the obvious problem:

LLMs don't remember.

A 1M context window is not memory. It's short-term recall that vanishes when the session ends.

**Tweet 3 (what you built)**

4 months ago I built a persistent memory system for my AI workflows.

Every correction I make gets stored permanently.
Every helpful memory gets stronger.
Every unhelpful memory fades.

1,421 memories. 87 corrections. Daily use.

My most-used correction has been surfaced 491 times. The AI never repeated that mistake once.

That's not a demo. That's 4 months of production data.

**Tweet 4 (the framework)**

Most AI memory systems do 2 things: Store and Recall.

That's a filing cabinet, not a brain.

Real memory has 5 steps:

Store → Recall → Correct → Feedback → Decay

Step 3 is what nobody does.

Corrections override everything. They surface first. They never fade.

You correct the AI once — it's permanent.

**Tweet 5 (the product)**

Today I'm releasing NeverOnce — the memory layer that learns from mistakes.

- 400 lines of Python
- Zero dependencies (just SQLite)
- Works with any LLM
- MCP server included (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
- MIT licensed

**Tweet 6 (the demo)**

5 lines of code:

```python
from neveronce import Memory
mem = Memory("my_app")
mem.store("user prefers metric")
mem.correct("never use imperial units")
mem.recall("what units?")  # correction first
```

That's it. That's the whole API.

**Tweet 7 (the vision)**

The future of AI isn't just smarter models.

It's models that learn from their mistakes.

I'm building that future. NeverOnce is step one.

If you're building AI agents and tired of starting from zero every session — try it.
